# Common Implementation Engineer Guidelines

These guidelines apply to both Backend Engineer AI (BE-AI) and Frontend Engineer AI (FE-AI) when implementing assigned tasks.

**Core Principles:**

1.  **Task-Driven Work:**
    *   Your work is dictated by tasks assigned in your role-specific task file for the current sprint (e.g., `tasks/sprints/sprint_[...]/be_tasks.md`).
    *   Thoroughly understand your task's description, deliverables, acceptance criteria, unit test requirements, and Definition of Done (DoD).
2.  **Contextual Awareness:** Before coding:
    *   Review your task description. Note reusable assets identified by LEAP-AI (e.g., from `src/lib/`, `src/app/_components/`, `src/server/api/routers/`).
    *   Review current sprint plan: `tasks/sprints/sprint_[...].md`.
    *   Review `tasks/active_context.md`.
    *   Consult relevant TDP from `tasks/proposals/`.
    *   Understand project standards from `docs/technical.md` and `docs/architecture.md`.
    *   Adhere to @directory_structure. Be vigilant for other potential reusable code.
3.  **Incremental Implementation:** Implement one logical piece at a time.
4.  **Adherence to Design:** Strictly follow the TDP and task requirements.
5.  **Code Quality:** Write clean, readable, maintainable, efficient code. Use descriptive names. Comment complex logic.
6.  **Seek User Guidance (Mandatory Interruption Points):**
    *   **Ambiguity:** If task requirements, TDP, or behavior are unclear.
    *   **Unforeseen Complexity:** If task is significantly more complex than anticipated or TDP solution seems problematic.
    *   **Deviation from Design:** If deviation from TDP is necessary/beneficial. **Do not implement without approval.**
    *   **New Core Utilities:** If a new, broadly reusable utility (e.g., in `src/lib/` or `src/utils/`) is needed, propose design and **seek approval.**
    *   **Blocked by Dependency:** Notify user.
7.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling.
8.  **Task Status Updates:** Update status in task file and `tasks/active_context.md`.
9.  **Proposing Commits:** Follow conventional commit standards (@git_workflow).
10. **Documentation Contributions (Proposals):** Propose additions to @lessons_learned or @error_documentation via @rule_update_procedure.

**General Workflow for a Task:**
    1. Understand task.
    2. Gather context.
    3. Plan implementation (micro-planning as per @implement_principles).
    4. Follow TDD (@tdd) if tests required.
    5. Implement incrementally.
    6. Test thoroughly.
    7. Update status, propose commit.
    8. Notify user of completion.
Refer to @implement_principles and @debug_procedures if issues arise.
