# Debugging Procedures (Next.js App Router Aware)

When you encounter persistent errors or unexpected behavior during task implementation that isn't immediately solvable:

1.  **Gather Information (Diagnose):**
    *   Collect all error messages, stack traces, and logs.
        *   **For Server-side issues (Server Components, tRPC resolvers, Server Actions):** Check your server console output where `next dev` or `next start` is running.
        *   **For Client-side issues (Client Components, tRPC hooks):** Use browser Developer Tools (Console, Network tab).
    *   Note the specific input data or user actions that trigger the error.
    *   Identify the relevant code sections (files, functions, lines) involved.
    *   Reference your current task description from your role-specific task file (e.g., `tasks/sprints/sprint_[...]/be_tasks.md`) and `tasks/active_context.md`.
    *   Consult `docs/architecture.md` (Next.js App Router structure) and `docs/technical.md` if the issue might relate to system design or tech stack behavior. Use `@Docs Next.js [query]`, `@Docs tRPC [query]` if you suspect a framework-level misunderstanding.

2.  **Analyze and Hypothesize:**
    *   Based on the gathered information, form a hypothesis about the root cause.
    *   Consider:
        *   Typos or syntax errors.
        *   Logical errors in your code.
        *   Incorrect usage of libraries or frameworks detailed in `docs/technical.md` (e.g., wrong tRPC hook usage, incorrect Server Component data fetching).
        *   Unexpected data or state (client-side vs. server-side).
        *   Issues with dependencies or environment.
        *   Misunderstanding of requirements or the TDP.
        *   Incorrect Server/Client Component boundary or prop passing.
    *   Use step-by-step reasoning. Think about the expected flow vs. the actual flow.

3.  **Verify Hypothesis (Isolate and Test):**
    *   Try to isolate the problematic code.
    *   Add `console.log` statements (or other language-appropriate logging) to inspect variable values and execution paths. Remember server-side logs appear in the terminal, client-side in the browser.
    *   Simplify the code or test with simpler inputs to see if the error persists.
    *   If you have unit tests (@tdd), ensure they are still relevant and passing for surrounding code. Consider writing a new test that specifically reproduces the bug.

4.  **Attempt a Fix:**
    *   Based on your verified hypothesis, implement a targeted fix.
    *   Make small, incremental changes.

5.  **Test the Fix:**
    *   Rerun the steps that triggered the error.
    *   Run any relevant unit tests.
    *   Ensure the fix doesn't introduce new problems (regressions).
    *   Be aware that errors in Server Components might be caught by `error.js` boundaries, while Client Component errors might also be caught there or manifest in the browser console directly.

6.  **If Still Stuck (Seek User Guidance):**
    *   If you've gone through these steps and cannot resolve the issue:
        *   Clearly document everything you've tried (steps 1-5).
        *   Present your findings, error messages, relevant code snippets, and your current hypothesis to the user.
        *   Explain why you are stuck.
        *   **Ask for specific guidance or suggestions.**

7.  **Learn from the Issue:**
    *   Once resolved (either by you or with user help), consider if this issue and its resolution should be proposed for @error_documentation or @lessons_learned via @rule_update_procedure.
