**File Naming Conventions:**
*   To ensure the `@filename` referencing works reliably and to maintain clarity, avoid duplicate filenames across different directories *unless absolutely necessary due to framework conventions (e.g., `page.tsx` in Next.js App Router)*.
*   When creating new documents or rule files, choose descriptive and unique names.
*   If a filename must be duplicated due to framework needs, be explicit with path context if ambiguity arises when discussing or referencing it.
