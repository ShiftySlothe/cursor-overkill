# Lessons Learned & Project Intelligence

This document serves as a learning journal for the project. Entries should be added when significant insights, patterns, or user preferences are identified that could benefit future development or AI understanding. Human curation is key.

**Structure for New Entries:**

```markdown
---
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Topic/Pattern:** [Brief, descriptive title]
**Context/Source:** [e.g., "User decision during Task FE-S1-005", "SRE-Gemini review of feature X", "BE-AI encountered while implementing Y"]
**Lesson/Insight/Decision:**
[Detailed explanation of the learning. What was the problem/situation? What was the decision/solution/pattern identified? Why is it important?]
**Implications/Action for AI (if any):**
[e.g., "FE-AI should prefer this approach for similar UI elements.", "SA-AI should consider this pattern for future data models.", "No direct AI action, for human awareness."]
**Keywords:** [tag1, tag2, tag3]
