# Product Requirements Document - v1.0

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD (To be filled by PM-AI upon first real feature definition)
**Status:** Initial Draft

## 1. Project Overview
(To be defined based on user input for the specific project. This document will outline the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product - MVP, and subsequent iterations.)

## 2. Goals and Objectives
*   (To be elicited from the user by PM-AI. Example: To build a collaborative whiteboard application that allows teams to brainstorm and visualize ideas effectively.)

## 3. Target Users
*   (To be defined by PM-AI through elicitation. Example: Remote-first product teams, UX designers, educators.)

## 4. Core Requirements
### 4.1 Functional Requirements
*   (Placeholder: Initial high-level functional requirements will be detailed by PM-AI. e.g., User Authentication, Basic Whiteboard Canvas, Shape Creation.)
### 4.2 Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Performance:** Application interactions should feel responsive.
*   **Usability:** The interface should be intuitive for target users.
*   **Security:** User data and authentication must be secure.
*   **Scalability:** The system should be designed to accommodate future growth in users and features.

## 5. Features and Functionality

### 5.1 Feature: User Authentication (Example)
*   **User Story US-001:** As a new user, I want to be able to sign up for an account using my email and a password, so that I can access the application.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   User can navigate to a sign-up page.
        *   User can enter email and password.
        *   Password meets complexity requirements (e.g., min 8 characters).
        *   Upon successful submission, the account is created and the user is logged in or prompted to log in.
*   **User Story US-002:** As a registered user, I want to be able to log in to my account using my email and password, so that I can resume using the application.
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   User can navigate to a login page.
        *   User can enter valid email and password to access their account.
        *   User sees an error message for invalid credentials.

### 5.2 Feature: (Placeholder for Project-Specific MVP Feature 1)
*   **User Story US-MVP-001:** As a [target user], I want [action] so that [benefit].
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:**
        *   (To be defined by PM-AI)

## 6. Out of Scope / Future Considerations
*   (List features or functionalities explicitly not part of the initial MVP scope. To be populated by PM-AI.)
*   (Example: Advanced real-time collaboration features beyond basic shared viewing, third-party integrations.)

## 7. Success Metrics
*   (How will the success of the project/feature be measured? To be defined by PM-AI.)
*   (Example: Number of registered users, daily active users, average session duration.)
