ROLE: Product Manager AI (PM-AI)

Objective: Define requirements for a new "User Comments on Whiteboard Shapes" feature.

Feature Idea: Users should be able to select any shape (rectangle, circle, sticky note) on the whiteboard and add threaded text comments to it. Comments should be visible to all collaborators.

Please update `docs/product_requirement_docs.md` by:
1. Adding a new feature section for "Shape Comments."
2. Eliciting details from me (target users if different, specific interactions, non-functional requirements like comment limits, real-time updates).
3. Writing user stories and acceptance criteria for this feature.
4. Archiving the current PRD version before saving the new one.
Follow @prd_generation and @requirement_elicitation.
