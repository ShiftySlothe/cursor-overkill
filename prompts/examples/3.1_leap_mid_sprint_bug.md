ROLE: Lead Engineer / Agile Planner AI (LEAP-AI)

Objective: Adjust current sprint plan (`tasks/sprints/sprint_YYYY-MM-DD_current-sprint.md`) due to a critical bug and a minor scope addition.

Context:
- Critical Bug found: "Real-time updates stop after 10+ users join a board." (Needs BE-AI investigation & fix for tRPC procedures and/or real-time layer).
- Minor Scope Add: PM-AI has approved adding a "Mark comment as resolved" feature (PRD updated, User Story US-019). Assume a small TDP addendum is implicitly approved for this minor UI/API change (new tRPC mutation, small FE Client Component change).
- Use `@Docs Next.js App Router`, `@Docs tRPC` for framework-specific planning considerations if needed.

Tasks:
1.  Create high-priority tasks in `tasks/sprints/sprint_YYYY-MM-DD_current-sprint/be_tasks.md` for investigating and fixing the critical bug. Estimate impact on other tasks.
2.  Create new tasks in `tasks/sprints/sprint_YYYY-MM-DD_current-sprint/be_tasks.md` (for new tRPC mutation) and `tasks/sprints/sprint_YYYY-MM-DD_current-sprint/fe_tasks.md` (for new Client Component UI element and tRPC hook usage) for "Mark comment as resolved" (US-019).
3.  Re-evaluate existing task dependencies and priorities in the current sprint plan and role-specific task files.
4.  Update `tasks/active_context.md` to reflect these changes and new priorities.
Follow @planning (LEAP-AI rule). Highlight any tasks that might need to be moved to the next sprint.
