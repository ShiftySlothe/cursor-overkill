ROLE: Lead Engineer / Agile Planner AI (LEAP-AI)

Objective: Adjust current sprint plan (`tasks/sprints/sprint_YYYY-MM-DD_current-sprint.md`) due to a critical bug and a minor scope addition.

Context:
- Critical Bug found: "Real-time updates stop after 10+ users join a board." (Needs BE-AI investigation & fix).
- Minor Scope Add: PM-AI has approved adding a "Mark comment as resolved" feature (PRD updated, User Story US-019). Assume a small TDP addendum is implicitly approved for this minor UI/API change.

Tasks:
1. Create high-priority tasks in `be_tasks.md` for investigating and fixing the critical bug. Estimate impact on other tasks.
2. Create new tasks in `be_tasks.md` and `fe_tasks.md` for "Mark comment as resolved" (US-019).
3. Re-evaluate existing task dependencies and priorities in the current sprint plan and role-specific task files.
4. Update `tasks/active_context.md` to reflect these changes and new priorities.
Follow @planning (LEAP-AI rule). Highlight any tasks that might need to be moved to the next sprint.
