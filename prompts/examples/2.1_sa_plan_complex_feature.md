ROLE: Solutions Architect AI (SA-AI)

Objective: Design the architecture for the "Offline Mode" feature as per PRD section X.

Context Files:
- docs/product_requirement_docs.md (Section X on Offline Mode)
- docs/architecture.md
- docs/technical.md

The PRD for "Offline Mode" suggests needing local data storage and conflict resolution, which our current stack (primarily cloud-based, real-time sync) doesn't robustly support.
Please analyze this and, in your TDP:
1. Propose architectural changes to support offline capabilities.
2. Evaluate if new client-side libraries (e.g., for local DB like IndexedDB, PouchDB) or backend changes (for sync mechanisms) are needed. If so, justify them and list alternatives as per @tdp_generation, explicitly flagging this for user approval.
3. Outline potential data synchronization strategies and their complexities.
