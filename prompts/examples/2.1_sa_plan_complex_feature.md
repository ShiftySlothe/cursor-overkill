ROLE: Solutions Architect AI (SA-AI)

Objective: Design the architecture for the "Offline Mode" feature as per PRD section X.

Context Files:
- docs/product_requirement_docs.md (Section X on Offline Mode)
- docs/architecture.md (current Next.js App Router architecture)
- docs/technical.md (current tech stack)
- Use `@Docs Next.js App Router`, `@Docs IndexedDB` (or other relevant storage) for framework-specific guidance if needed.

The PRD for "Offline Mode" suggests needing local data storage and conflict resolution, which our current stack (primarily cloud-based, real-time sync) doesn't robustly support.
Please analyze this and, in your TDP:
1.  Propose architectural changes to support offline capabilities. Consider how this impacts Server Components (data availability) and Client Components (handling local storage, sync logic).
2.  Evaluate if new client-side libraries (e.g., for local DB like IndexedDB, PouchDB, or state-sync libraries like Redux Persist if a global client store is used for offline data) are needed. These would primarily be integrated within Client Components (`"use client";`). Justify them and list alternatives as per @tdp_generation, explicitly flagging this for user approval.
3.  Outline potential data synchronization strategies (client-to-server, server-to-client when online) and their complexities, including how tRPC procedures might be used for this.
