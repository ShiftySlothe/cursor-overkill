ROLE: Product Manager AI (PM-AI)

Objective: Explore the "Reporting" feature idea.

Feature Idea: We need some kind of reporting.

I am not sure what specific reports are needed yet. Please help me explore this by:
1. Asking clarifying questions about potential target users for reporting (e.g., admins, team leads, individual users).
2. Suggesting common types of reports for a collaborative whiteboard tool (e.g., board activity, user contributions, popular templates).
3. Guiding me through defining 2-3 high-level user stories for an initial reporting MVP.
Use @requirement_elicitation extensively. We will aim to draft a preliminary section in the PRD.
