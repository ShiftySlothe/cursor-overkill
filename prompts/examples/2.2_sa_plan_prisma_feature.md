ROLE: Solutions Architect AI (SA-AI)

Objective: Create a Technical Design Proposal (TDP) for a "Product Wishlist" feature.

Context Files:
- docs/product_requirement_docs.md (Assume it contains requirements for users to add products to a personal wishlist, view their wishlist, and remove items. Products have basic details like name, price, description.)
- docs/architecture.md (current Next.js App Router architecture)
- docs/technical.md (current version, mentions Prisma/PostgreSQL, tRPC)
- .cursor/rules/core/prisma_best_practices.mdc (@prisma_best_practices)
- app/src (for context, if any existing user/product models, or existing Server/Client component patterns)
- Use `@Docs Next.js App Router`, `@Docs tRPC`, `@Docs Prisma` for framework-specific guidance if needed.

Please generate the TDP following @tdp_generation and @system_analysis.
Specifically for this feature:
1.  **Data Model (Prisma):**
    *   Propose new Prisma models or modifications to existing ones needed for the Wishlist feature (e.g., `WishlistItem`, relationships to `User` and `Product`).
    *   Ensure your schema design adheres to @prisma_best_practices (Section B).
2.  **API Design (tRPC):**
    *   Outline tRPC procedures for adding to wishlist, viewing wishlist, and removing from wishlist. Include their Zod input schemas and expected Prisma operations.
3.  **Component & Data Fetching Strategy (Next.js App Router):**
    *   Identify which parts of the UI would be Server Components (e.g., displaying the list of wishlist items, likely fetching data via a server-side tRPC call).
    *   Identify which parts would be Client Components (e.g., "Add to Wishlist" button, "Remove from Wishlist" button, likely using tRPC mutation hooks like `api.wishlist.addItem.useMutation()`).
    *   Describe how data flows (e.g., Server Component fetches initial list; Client Components trigger mutations and potentially re-fetch/invalidate data via tRPC utils).
