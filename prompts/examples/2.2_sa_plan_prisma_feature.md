ROLE: Solutions Architect AI (SA-AI)

Objective: Create a Technical Design Proposal (TDP) for a "Product Wishlist" feature.

Context Files:
- docs/product_requirement_docs.md (Assume it contains requirements for users to add products to a personal wishlist, view their wishlist, and remove items. Products have basic details like name, price, description.)
- docs/architecture.md (current version)
- docs/technical.md (current version, mentions Prisma/PostgreSQL)
- .cursor/rules/core/prisma_best_practices.mdc (@prisma_best_practices)
- src/ (for context, if any existing user/product models)

Please generate the TDP following @tdp_generation and @system_analysis.
Specifically for the data model:
1. Propose new Prisma models or modifications to existing ones needed for the Wishlist feature (e.g., `WishlistItem`, relationships to `User` and `Product`).
2. Ensure your schema design adheres to @prisma_best_practices (Section B).
3. Outline tRPC procedures for adding to wishlist, viewing wishlist, and removing from wishlist, including their Zod input schemas and expected Prisma operations.
