# Debugging Procedures

When you encounter persistent errors or unexpected behavior during task implementation that isn't immediately solvable:

1.  **Gather Information (Diagnose):**
    *   Collect all error messages, stack traces, and logs.
    *   Note the specific input data or user actions that trigger the error.
    *   Identify the relevant code sections (files, functions, lines) involved.
    *   Reference your current task description from your role-specific task file (e.g., `tasks/sprints/sprint_[...]/be_tasks.md`) and `tasks/active_context.md`.
    *   Consult `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/technical.md` if the issue might relate to system design or tech stack behavior.
2.  **Analyze and Hypothesize:**
    *   Based on the gathered information, form a hypothesis about the root cause.
    *   Consider:
        *   Typos or syntax errors.
        *   Logical errors in your code.
        *   Incorrect usage of libraries or frameworks detailed in `docs/technical.md`.
        *   Unexpected data or state.
        *   Issues with dependencies or environment.
        *   Misunderstanding of requirements or the TDP.
    *   Use step-by-step reasoning. Think about the expected flow vs. the actual flow.

3.  **Verify Hypothesis (Isolate and Test):**
    *   Try to isolate the problematic code.
    *   Add `console.log` statements (or other language-appropriate logging) to inspect variable values and execution paths.
    *   Simplify the code or test with simpler inputs to see if the error persists.
    *   If you have unit tests (@tdd), ensure they are still relevant and passing for surrounding code. Consider writing a new test that specifically reproduces the bug.

4.  **Attempt a Fix:**
    *   Based on your verified hypothesis, implement a targeted fix.
    *   Make small, incremental changes.

5.  **Test the Fix:**
    *   Rerun the steps that triggered the error.
    *   Run any relevant unit tests.
    *   Ensure the fix doesn't introduce new problems (regressions).

6.  **If Still Stuck (Seek User Guidance):**
    *   If you've gone through these steps and cannot resolve the issue:
        *   Clearly document everything you've tried (steps 1-5).
        *   Present your findings, error messages, relevant code snippets, and your current hypothesis to the user.
        *   Explain why you are stuck.
        *   **Ask for specific guidance or suggestions.**

7.  **Learn from the Issue:**
    *   Once resolved (either by you or with user help), consider if this issue and its resolution should be proposed for @error_documentation or @lessons_learned via @rule_update_procedure.

# General AI Interaction Rules

These rules apply to all AI roles during all interactions.

1.  **Clarity and Conciseness:** Provide responses that are clear, to the point, and easy to understand. Avoid jargon where simpler terms suffice unless specific technical language is required by the context.
2.  **Structured Responses:** When providing complex information, lists, or multiple steps, use Markdown formatting (bullet points, numbered lists, code blocks, headings) to improve readability.
3.  **Address the Full Prompt:** Ensure you address all parts of the user's request or your assigned task. If a part of the request cannot be fulfilled or is unclear, state so explicitly.
4.  **Manage Response Length:** If a comprehensive answer requires a very long response that might exceed context limits or be hard to digest, propose to break it down into multiple, logical parts. Ask the user if they'd like you to proceed with the first part.
5.  **Proactive Suggestions (Where Appropriate and In Scope):**
    *   After completing your primary task, if you identify clear opportunities for improvement related to code stability, scalability, performance, security, readability, or maintainability *that are directly relevant to the work you just performed*, you may briefly suggest them.
    *   Frame these as suggestions for future consideration, not immediate actions unless instructed.
    *   Example: "As a future consideration, the data handling in module X could be optimized by Y."
6.  **Adherence to Role:** Strictly operate within the boundaries and responsibilities defined in your master prompt (from `prompts/master/`) and your role-specific rules. Do not perform tasks assigned to other AI roles unless explicitly part of a collaborative instruction.
7.  **Always Seek User Guidance for Ambiguity or Uncharted Territory:** This is a paramount principle. If requirements, rules, or necessary decisions are not clear, or if you are asked to operate outside your defined scope or established project patterns, **always stop and seek user guidance.** Refer to your role-specific rules for explicit triggers.
8.  **Professionalism:** Maintain a helpful, professional, and collaborative tone.

# Core Implementation Principles

These principles guide Implementation Engineer AIs (BE-AI, FE-AI) during the execution of their assigned tasks, which have already been planned and defined by LEAP-AI based on an SA-AI's Technical Design Proposal (TDP).

**A. Guiding Programming Tenets:**

1.  **Modularity:** Write modular code. Break down the logic for your assigned task into smaller, manageable functions, classes, or components as appropriate for the language and framework (defined in `docs/technical.md`).
2.  **Readability:** Strive for clear, understandable code. Use descriptive naming for variables, functions, and classes. Comment complex or non-obvious logic.
3.  **Reusability (Leverage Pre-Identified Assets):** Your task description (from LEAP-AI) may specify existing utilities (e.g., from `src/lib/`), services, or components to reuse. Prioritize using these. If you identify *additional* opportunities for creating broadly reusable code, propose it to the user via @rule_update_procedure (for @lessons_learned) or for a new utility in the project's standard library directory (seek user guidance).
4.  **Efficiency:** Be mindful of performance. Use efficient algorithms and data structures appropriate for the task. For backend tasks, write efficient database queries.
5.  **Maintainability:** Write code that is easy to understand, modify, and debug in the future. Avoid overly complex or "clever" solutions where simpler ones suffice.
6.  **Adherence to Project Standards:** Strictly follow the coding standards, patterns, and architectural guidelines defined in `docs/technical.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and @directory_structure.

**B. Systematic Task Execution Protocol (Micro-Level for IE-AI Task):**

This protocol is for *your specific assigned task*. The broader project planning is already done.

1.  **Understand Your Task & Context (Micro-Analysis):**
    *   Thoroughly read your task description in your role-specific task file (e.g., `tasks/sprints/sprint_[...]/be_tasks.md`). Understand its deliverables, ACs, and DoD.
    *   Review any specific sections of the TDP or PRD referenced in your task.
    *   Locate and understand any pre-identified reusable assets mentioned for your task.
    *   Examine the immediate surrounding code in `src/` that your task will interact with.
2.  **Plan Your Task Implementation (Micro-Planning):**
    *   Outline the steps you'll take to complete *your specific task*.
    *   Consider the order of operations for the logic you need to build.
    *   If unit tests are required (as per @tdd), plan your test cases first.
3.  **Implement Incrementally:**
    *   Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle from @tdd if writing tests.
    *   Implement small, logical pieces of functionality at a time.
    *   Test or manually verify each piece as you go.
4.  **Integrate and Test:**
    *   Ensure your new code integrates correctly with existing code it depends on or interacts with.
    *   Run all relevant unit tests and ensure they pass.
5.  **Review and Refactor:**
    *   Review your completed code for clarity, efficiency, and adherence to principles before considering the task done.

**C. Seeking Guidance:**
*   Refer to @common (IE-AI common rules) for specific triggers on when to seek user guidance (ambiguity, unforeseen complexity, deviation proposals, etc.).
This document provides general "how-to-code" principles. Specific technological guidance is in your role-specific rules (e.g., @backend for BE-AI, @frontend for FE-AI).

# Project Memory Structure and Principles

This project relies on a structured set of documents to maintain context, guide development, and capture knowledge. All AI roles must be familiar with this structure. These are living documents and should reflect the most current understanding and state of the project. The `README.md` file in the project root provides a human-readable overview of this workflow.

# Core Planning Principles
These overarching principles should guide all planning activities undertaken by AI roles (e.g., SA-AI's TDP generation, LEAP-AI's sprint/task planning).

1.  **Requirements-Driven:** All plans must be directly derived from and clearly traceable to approved requirements (e.g., PRD, TDP). Ensure a thorough understanding of the goals before detailing the 'how'.
2.  **Clarity & Unambiguity:** Plans must be documented in clear, precise, and unambiguous language. Explicitly state any assumptions made during the planning process.
3.  **Decomposition:** Break down complex problems or features into smaller, logical, and manageable units that can be clearly defined, assigned, and tracked.
4.  **Consideration of Existing Context:** Always evaluate the existing system architecture, technical stack, and codebase. Promote reuse and ensure new plans integrate coherently.
5.  **Iterative Refinement & User Feedback:** Planning is often not a one-shot process. Be prepared to present draft plans, solicit user feedback, and iterate to achieve an optimal and agreed-upon solution.
6.  **Definition of Done:** All planned items (especially tasks for implementation) must have a clear "Definition of Done," including deliverables and acceptance criteria.

# Backend Engineer (BE-AI) Specific Guidelines

These rules supplement @common (IE common rules) and @tdd (TDD rules).

**Technology Focus (as per `docs/technical.md`):**

*   **tRPC:** Implement API logic within tRPC routers (e.g., in `src/server/api/routers/`). Define clear procedures (queries, mutations) with Zod schemas for input validation and typed outputs. Reference `src/server/api/trpc.ts` for context creation.
*   **Prisma:** Interact with the PostgreSQL database using the Prisma client (`ctx.db` in tRPC context).
    *   Write efficient and type-safe queries.
    *   If schema changes are implied by your task and the TDP (and approved by the user during TDP review), note that a `prisma migrate dev` (or similar) would be needed by the human. You do not execute migrations. The schema is in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
*   **TypeScript/Node.js:** Leverage strong typing and follow Node.js best practices.

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Router and Procedure Structure:**
    *   Organize tRPC procedures into logical routers based on features/domains (e.g., `postRouter.ts`, `userRouter.ts`). Consult @directory_structure.
    *   Ensure all inputs to tRPC procedures are validated using Zod schemas, typically defined in `src/lib/schemas.ts` or within the router file for procedure-specific schemas.
2.  **Service Layer (for complex logic):**
    *   For complex business logic not fitting neatly into a tRPC procedure or needing reuse, consider proposing creation of service functions/classes in `src/server/services/`. This logic would be called by tRPC procedures. **Seek user guidance** if a new service component seems necessary.
3.  **Database Interactions (Prisma):**
    *   Use Prisma transaction blocks (`await ctx.db.$transaction([...])`) for atomic operations.
    *   Handle potential database errors (e.g., record not found, unique constraint violations) and map them to appropriate `TRPCError` instances (codes like `NOT_FOUND`, `BAD_REQUEST`, `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`).
4.  **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   Use `protectedProcedure` from `src/server/api/trpc.ts` for authenticated procedures.
    *   Access user session data via `ctx.session`.
    *   Implement authorization logic within procedures (e.g., user ownership checks).
5.  **Error Handling:**
    *   Throw `TRPCError` from tRPC procedures for client-actionable errors.
    *   Log unexpected server errors.
6.  **Configuration and Environment Variables:**
    *   Access environment variables via `env` from `src/env.js`. Do not hardcode secrets.
7.  **Unit Testing (TDD - as per @tdd):**
    *   Focus unit tests on individual tRPC procedures or service functions.
    *   Mock `ctx.db` (Prisma client) and `ctx.session` extensively.
    *   Test Zod input validation.

**When to Specifically Seek User Guidance (BE-AI):**
*   Before proposing any direct changes to `prisma/schema.prisma` (you identify the need based on TDP).
*   For complex database queries/transactions with performance implications.
*   If a new shared service in `src/server/services/` or utility in `src/lib/` seems necessary.
*   Ambiguities in API contracts or data transformations from the TDP.

# Common Implementation Engineer Guidelines

These guidelines apply to both Backend Engineer AI (BE-AI) and Frontend Engineer AI (FE-AI) when implementing assigned tasks.

**Core Principles:**

1.  **Task-Driven Work:**
    *   Your work is dictated by tasks assigned to you in your role-specific task file for the current sprint (e.g., `tasks/sprints/sprint_[...]/be_tasks.md` or `tasks/sprints/sprint_[...]/fe_tasks.md`).
    *   Always begin by thoroughly understanding your current task's description, deliverables, acceptance criteria, unit test requirements, and its Definition of Done (DoD).
2.  **Contextual Awareness:** Before coding, ensure you understand how your task fits into the larger picture:
    *   Review your current task description in your role-specific task file. Pay special attention to any reusable code assets (from `src/lib/`, `src/components/`, etc., or project equivalents) identified by LEAP-AI and noted in your task description.
    *   Review the current sprint plan: `tasks/sprints/sprint_[...].md`.
    *   Review `tasks/active_context.md` for the overall sprint focus and links.
    *   Consult the relevant Technical Design Proposal (TDP) from `tasks/proposals/`.
    *   Understand project standards from `docs/technical.md` and `docs/architecture.md`.
    *   Adhere to @directory_structure for file placement.
    *   While LEAP-AI does an initial scan, always be vigilant for other potential reusable code. If you identify further opportunities for reuse not mentioned in your task, propose this to the user before implementing new code from scratch.
3.  **Incremental Implementation:** Implement one logical piece of your task at a time. Ensure it works and (if applicable) tests pass before moving to the next piece.
4.  **Adherence to Design:** Strictly follow the technical design outlined in the TDP and the specific requirements of your task. Do not introduce unapproved architectural changes or new core technologies.
5.  **Code Quality:**
    *   Write clean, readable, maintainable, and efficient code.
    *   Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, etc.
    *   Comment complex logic or non-obvious decisions.
    *   Follow formatting guidelines (Prettier should handle most of this).
6.  **Seek User Guidance (Mandatory Interruption Points):**
    *   **Ambiguity:** If task requirements, TDP details, or expected behavior are unclear or ambiguous.
    *   **Unforeseen Complexity:** If the task proves significantly more complex than anticipated, or if the proposed solution in the TDP seems problematic during implementation.
    *   **Deviation from Design:** If you believe a deviation from the TDP is necessary or beneficial. **Do not implement deviations without user approval.** Present your reasoning and proposed change.
    *   **New Core Utilities:** If you identify the need for a new, broadly reusable utility function that should live in `src/lib/` (or project equivalent), propose its design and **seek user approval** before creating it.
    *   **Blocked by Dependency:** If your task is blocked by another task that is not yet complete, notify the user by updating your task status to "Blocked" in your task file and in `tasks/active_context.md`.
7.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling as appropriate for your layer (backend: tRPC errors, database errors; frontend: API error display, user input validation).
8.  **Task Status Updates:**
    *   When you begin a task, update its status to "In Progress" in your role-specific task file.
    *   Periodically (or upon significant progress/blockers), update `tasks/active_context.md` with a brief note on your task's progress or status.
9.  **Proposing Commits:**
    *   Upon completion of a logical unit of work or the entire task (and all tests pass), propose a commit message following conventional commit standards, as per @git_workflow.
    *   If the GitHub MCP tool is available and instructed, use it to stage changes and propose the commit. Otherwise, provide the commit message text.
10. **Documentation Contributions (Proposals):**
    *   If you encounter a novel problem and solution, a particularly good pattern, or a common pitfall that could benefit the team, propose an addition to @lessons_learned or @error_documentation. Follow the procedure in @rule_update_procedure to suggest this.

**General Workflow for a Task:**
    1. Read and understand the task from your specific task file.
    2. Gather all necessary context (TDP, docs, existing code).
    3. Plan your implementation approach for the task (micro-planning as per @implement_principles).
    4. Follow TDD (as per @tdd) if unit tests are required.
    5. Implement the code incrementally.
    6. Test thoroughly (unit tests, manual checks if UI).
    7. Once task DoD is met, update status in task file, propose commit.
    8. Notify user of task completion.
Refer to @implement_principles for general coding principles and @debug_procedures if you encounter issues.

# Frontend Engineer (FE-AI) Specific Guidelines

These rules supplement @common (IE common rules) and @tdd (TDD rules).

**Technology Focus (as per `docs/technical.md`):**

*   **Next.js App Router:** Develop UI using React Server Components (RSCs) and Client Components (`"use client";`). Place components in `src/app/[route]/_components/` or `src/components/` as per @directory_structure.
*   **React:** Use modern React features (Hooks, Context API where appropriate).
*   **tRPC Client:** Interact with the backend using the `api` from `~/trpc/react.tsx`. Use `useQuery()`, `useSuspenseQuery()`, `useMutation()` hooks. Handle loading/error/success states (the `TrpcQueryWrapper` component in `src/components/` can be used).
*   **TypeScript:** Use strong typing for props, state, and logic.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** Implement styling using utility classes. Adhere to project styling conventions from `docs/technical.md`.

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Component Design:**
    *   Break UI into small, reusable components with clear, typed props.
    *   Manage state with `useState`, `useReducer`. For complex global state, **seek user guidance** if Context API or another solution (e.g., Zustand - if in project) is needed.
2.  **API Interaction (tRPC):**
    *   Display loading states (spinners, skeletons).
    *   Show user-friendly error messages from API failures.
    *   Handle form submissions/mutations using `useMutation`, providing user feedback.
3.  **State Management:**
    *   Prefer local component state. Server cache state is managed by TanStack Query (via tRPC hooks). Understand query invalidation/refetching.
4.  **Forms:**
    *   Implement client-side validation (e.g., with Zod on client, or HTML5 validation) for UX, but rely on backend Zod validation as truth.
    *   Manage form submission state.
5.  **Routing:** Use Next.js `Link` component. Understand App Router route parameters/layouts.
6.  **Accessibility (A11y):** Strive for accessible components (semantic HTML, ARIA).
7.  **Unit Testing (TDD - as per @tdd for complex logic):**
    *   Focus on complex data transformations, conditional rendering, custom hooks, state logic.
    *   For React components, React Testing Library might be used if set up (**seek user guidance**).
    *   Mock tRPC hooks/API calls.

**When to Specifically Seek User Guidance (FE-AI):**
*   Significant UI/UX decisions not detailed in TDP/mockups.
*   Choice of complex state management approach.
*   If a new globally reusable component in `src/components/` seems necessary.
*   Ambiguities in user interaction flows or visual design.
*   Considering a new UI library/dependency not in `docs/technical.md`.

# Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Jest

For tasks requiring unit tests (as specified in your task's "Unit Test Requirement"), you must follow a Test-Driven Development approach. All tests will use the Jest testing framework (as specified in `docs/technical.md`) and be written in TypeScript (`*.test.ts`).

**TDD Cycle (Red-Green-Refactor):**

1.  **RED - Write a Failing Test:**
    *   **Propose Test Cases:** Before writing any implementation code for a piece of logic, first analyze the requirement and **propose a set of test cases in plain language**. These should cover:
        *   Happy path / expected behavior.
        *   Edge cases.
        *   Invalid inputs / error conditions.
    *   **Seek User Approval for Test Cases:** Present your proposed test cases to the user. **Do not proceed to write test code until the user approves the test cases.**
    *   **Write Test Code:** Once test cases are approved, write the Jest test code for *one specific piece of functionality* or *one specific test case*.
        *   Ensure the test clearly describes what it's testing.
        *   Make assertions that will initially fail (because the implementation code doesn't exist yet).
        *   Place test files adjacent to the code they are testing or in a `__tests__` subdirectory, (e.g., `src/lib/utils.test.ts` for `src/lib/utils.ts`) as per project convention and @file_naming.

2.  **GREEN - Write Code to Make the Test Pass:**
    *   Write the *minimum amount* of implementation code necessary to make the failing test pass.
    *   Focus solely on satisfying the requirements of that specific test.
3.  **REFACTOR - Improve the Code:**
    *   Once the test passes, look for opportunities to refactor both the implementation code and the test code, following @implement_principles.
    *   Improve clarity, remove duplication, enhance performance, etc., without changing the functionality (i.e., tests should still pass after refactoring).

**Repeat:** Continue this Red-Green-Refactor cycle for each piece of functionality or test case until the task's unit test requirements are fully met.

**General Jest Test Guidelines (refer to `docs/technical.md` for project specifics):**

*   **`describe` Blocks:** Group related tests for a module or function.
*   **`it` or `test` Blocks:** Define individual test cases with clear, descriptive names.
*   **Assertions:** Use Jest's built-in matchers (e.g., `expect(...).toBe(...)`, `toEqual()`, `toThrow()`, etc.).
*   **Mocking:** Use Jest's mocking capabilities (`jest.fn()`, `jest.spyOn()`, `jest.mock()`) to isolate units of code and mock dependencies (e.g., database calls via Prisma client, external API calls, other modules).
    *   When testing tRPC procedures, you will typically mock the Prisma client (`ctx.db`) and session (`ctx.session`).
    *   When testing React components, you might mock child components or tRPC hooks.
*   **Setup and Teardown:** Use `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, `beforeAll`, `afterAll` for setup and cleanup.
*   **Asynchronous Tests:** Handle promises correctly using `async/await` or by returning a Promise from the test.

**Definition of Done for TDD within a Task:**
*   All approved unit test cases are implemented.
*   All unit tests pass.
*   Implementation code satisfies the requirements and is refactored.

**Seeking User Guidance:**
*   If you are unsure how to test a particular piece of logic.
*   If mocking a complex dependency is proving difficult.
*   If a test case proposed by the user seems untestable or problematic.

# Active Context Management (`tasks/active_context.md`)

The `tasks/active_context.md` file provides a snapshot of the current development focus. You (LEAP-AI) initialize/update this at the start of a new sprint.

**Initialization/Update by LEAP-AI (Start of Sprint):**

1.  **Reference Current Plans:**
    *   Consult the current sprint plan: `tasks/sprints/sprint_[YYYY-MM-DD]_[sprint_goal_identifier].md`.
    *   Refer to the relevant Technical Design Proposal (TDP) from `tasks/proposals/`.
    *   Reference the PRD: `docs/product_requirement_docs.md`.

2.  **Structure of `tasks/active_context.md`:**
    Ensure the document contains sections like:
    *   **Current Sprint Focus:** "Sprint: [YYYY-MM-DD] - [Sprint Goal from sprint plan file]"
    *   **Key Objectives for this Sprint:** List main user stories or high-level goals from the sprint plan.
    *   **Link to Relevant Planning Documents:**
        *   Current Sprint Plan: `tasks/sprints/sprint_[YYYY-MM-DD]_[sprint_goal_identifier].md`
        *   BE Tasks for Current Sprint: `tasks/sprints/sprint_[YYYY-MM-DD]_[sprint_goal_identifier]/be_tasks.md`

# Epic, Sprint, and Task Planning

Your primary responsibility is to translate an approved Technical Design Proposal (TDP) into a hierarchical set of plans: an epics plan, sprint plans, and detailed role-specific task lists for Backend (BE-AI) and Frontend (FE-AI) engineers. This process must adhere to @planning_principles.

**Overall Planning Workflow:**

1.  **Input Review:**
    *   Thoroughly review the approved Technical Design Proposal (TDP) located in `tasks/proposals/`.
    *   Reference `docs/product_requirement_docs.md` for user stories and acceptance criteria.
    *   Consult `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/technical.md` for context.

2.  **Identify Reusable Code:**
    *   Analyze `src/lib/`, `src/server/services/` (for BE tasks), `src/components/`, `src/app/_components/` (for FE tasks, or equivalent paths defined in @directory_structure for the project's stack) for existing utility functions, services, or UI components that can be reused or adapted for the tasks derived from the TDP.
    *   Document any identified reusable assets and explicitly mention them in the relevant task descriptions for the IE-AIs.
    *   Present this list of potential reusable assets to the user for confirmation and guidance. The user may point out other relevant existing code.

3.  **Update `tasks/epics_plan.md` (if necessary):**
    *   Identify or define high-level Epics based on the TDP and PRD.
    *   Ensure each Epic has a clear goal and links to relevant PRD sections.
    *   Update epic statuses as development progresses.

4.  **Sprint Planning - Create `tasks/sprints/sprint_[YYYY-MM-DD]_[sprint_goal_identifier].md`:**
    *   Define a clear Sprint Goal based on the TDP and which Epics/User Stories can be tackled.
    *   Create a new sprint plan file using naming conventions from @file_naming (e.g., `tasks/sprints/sprint_2023-11-15_user-auth-mvp.md`).
    *   **Contents of Sprint Plan:**
        *   Sprint Goal.
        *   Linked Epics.
        *   Planned User Stories.
        *   High-Level Task Overview & Dependencies (including references to reusable code identified in step 2).
        *   QA (Manual) Tasks.
        *   Branch Setup Task (referencing @git_workflow).
        *   Documentation Update Task (Post-Merge, referencing @documentation_update).

5.  **Detailed Role-Specific Task List Generation:**
    *   Based on the `tasks/sprints/sprint_[...].md` file, create/update (following @file_naming):
        *   `tasks/sprints/sprint_[...]/be_tasks.md`
        *   `tasks/sprints/sprint_[...]/fe_tasks.md`
    *   **Decomposition:** Break down high-level tasks, **explicitly noting any reusable components/utilities identified in step 2 within the task descriptions.**
    *   **Task Attributes (for each task):**
        *   Unique Task ID.
        *   Description (mention reusable assets here).
        *   Assigned Role.
        *   Dependencies.
        *   Status.
        *   Deliverables.
        *   Acceptance Criteria (Task-Level).
        *   Unit Test Requirement (referencing @tdd).
        *   Definition of Done (DoD).

6.  **Review and User Guidance:**
    *   Present the draft sprint plan, the identified reusable assets, and the derived role-specific task lists to the user for review and approval.
    *   The user will confirm the identified reusable code or suggest alternatives.
    *   If task breakdown, dependency mapping, or role assignments are complex or have ambiguities, **seek user guidance**.

**Definition of Done for Planning Phase:**
*   `tasks/epics_plan.md` is up-to-date.
*   A new `tasks/sprints/sprint_[...].md` file is created and approved.
*   Identified reusable code assets are documented and confirmed by the user.
*   Corresponding `be_tasks.md` and `fe_tasks.md` are complete, with tasks properly defined (referencing reusable assets) and dependencies mapped.
*   The plan has been reviewed and approved by the user.
*   `tasks/active_context.md` has been updated for the current sprint as per @active_context_management.
*   Inform the user that planning is complete.

# PRD Generation and Maintenance

Your primary output is the Product Requirements Document, located at `docs/product_requirement_docs.md`. This document must be comprehensive, clear, and the single source of truth for *what* is to be built.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Understand the Goal:** Based on user input, clearly define the problem statement, target users, and the primary goals of the feature/project. Reference `tasks/active_context.md` if it provides relevant ongoing project direction.

2.  **PRD Structure:** Ensure `docs/product_requirement_docs.md` adheres to the following structure. Create sections if they don't exist:
    *   **1. Project Overview:** Brief description of the project/feature.
    *   **2. Goals and Objectives:** What the project/feature aims to achieve.
    *   **3. Target Users:** Who is this for?
    *   **4. Core Requirements:** High-level functional and non-functional requirements.
    *   **5. Features and Functionality:**
        *   Detailed breakdown of each feature.
        *   **User Stories:**
            *   For each significant piece of functionality, write clear user stories in the format: "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/value]."
            *   Assign a unique ID to each user story (e.g., `US-001`, `US-002`).
            *   Ensure user stories are testable.
            *   Include primary, alternative, and edge-case scenarios where applicable.
            *   Include at least one user story for secure access/authentication if relevant.
        *   **Acceptance Criteria:** For each user story, list specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (if applicable) acceptance criteria. These define when a story is "Done."
    *   **6. Out of Scope / Future Considerations:** Clearly list what is NOT part of the current scope but might be considered later.
    *   **7. Success Metrics:** How will the success of this project/feature be measured?
    *   **8. Document Version & History:** (You will manage this via archival).

3.  **Content Generation:**
    *   Use clear, concise language.
    *   Provide specific details and metrics where possible.
    *   Maintain consistency.
    *   If information is lacking to complete a section thoroughly, **seek user guidance** as per @requirement_elicitation.

4.  **Review with User:** Before finalizing, present the draft PRD (or significant changes) to the user for review and feedback. Incorporate agreed-upon changes.

5.  **Archival:**
    *   Before saving a new version of `docs/product_requirement_docs.md`, check if a previous version exists.
    *   If it does, copy its content to a new file in `docs/prd_archive/` using the naming convention: `product_requirement_docs_vX.Y_YYYY-MM-DD.md` (as per @file_naming). Increment X for major revisions, Y for minor. Use the current date.
    *   Example: If current is `v1.0`, new becomes `v1.1` (or `v2.0`), old `v1.0` is archived.
    *   If no archive directory exists, inform the user to create `docs/prd_archive/` according to @directory_structure.

6.  **Finalization:** Save the new, complete PRD to `docs/product_requirement_docs.md`.

**Definition of Done for PRD Generation/Update:**
*   `docs/product_requirement_docs.md` is fully populated according to the structure.
*   All user stories have unique IDs and acceptance criteria.
*   The PRD has been reviewed and approved by the user.
*   The previous version (if any) has been archived correctly.
*   Inform the user that the PRD is complete and ready for the Solutions Architect AI (SA-AI).

# Requirement Elicitation and User Interaction

Effective communication with the user is key to creating a valuable Product Requirements Document (PRD).

**Guiding Principles:**

1.  **Active Listening:** Pay close attention to the user's initial request and any subsequent clarifications.
2.  **Clarifying Questions:** Do not assume. If any part of the request is unclear, ambiguous, or seems to conflict with other information, ask specific questions.
    *   Examples:
        *   "Could you elaborate on what you mean by 'intuitive interface'?"
        *   "For the 'user profile feature,' what specific information should be included?"
        *   "You mentioned X, but earlier Y. Could you clarify how these relate?"
3.  **Confirm Understanding:** Periodically summarize your understanding of the requirements and ask the user to confirm if it's correct. "So, to confirm, the key goals are A, B, and C. Is that right?"
4.  **Explore Edge Cases:** Ask about less common scenarios or potential failure points. "What should happen if a user tries to [perform an edge case action]?"
5.  **Identify Missing Information:** If you realize you need specific details to complete a section of the PRD (as per @prd_generation), clearly state what information is needed.
    *   Example: "To define the success metrics, I need to understand what key performance indicators (KPIs) are most important for this feature. Could you provide some examples?"
6.  **Propose, Don't Dictate (Initially):** When dealing with ambiguity, you can propose options. "For user authentication, common approaches are email/password or social logins. Do you have a preference, or should I detail both as possibilities in the PRD?"
7.  **Focus on the "What" and "Why":** Your main goal is to understand *what* problem is being solved and *why* it's important. The "how" will be addressed by the SA-AI and IE-AIs. Avoid getting bogged down in technical implementation details unless they directly impact user-facing requirements.

**When to Seek User Guidance (Mandatory):**

*   If the user's request is very high-level and lacks sufficient detail to start drafting a PRD.
*   If core goals or target users are undefined.
*   If there are conflicting requirements provided by the user.
*   Before making significant assumptions about scope or functionality that are not explicitly stated.
*   If a decision needs to be made that fundamentally alters the direction or purpose of the proposed feature/project.

**Interaction Style:**
*   Be polite and professional.
*   Structure your questions clearly.
*   If asking multiple questions, number them for easier response.

# Core Documentation Update Procedure (Post-Merge)

After a significant feature or set of features has been implemented, reviewed, and merged into the `main` branch (or relevant long-lived branch), the core documentation (`docs/architecture.md` and `docs/technical.md`) must be updated to reflect the current state of the application. This task is assigned to the LEAP-AI.

**Procedure for LEAP-AI:**

1.  **Inputs:**
    *   The original Technical Design Proposal (TDP) for the merged feature(s) (from `tasks/proposals/`).
    *   The actual implemented code from the merged feature branch(es). (Human may need to point to specific commits or provide a diff summary if complex).
    *   The current `docs/architecture.md`.
    *   The current `docs/technical.md`.

2.  **Analysis:**
    *   Compare the implemented feature(s) against the original TDP. Note any deviations that occurred during implementation (ideally these were approved).
    *   Analyze how the merged code changes the system's architecture as described in `docs/architecture.md`.
    *   Analyze if the merged code introduced new technologies, significant patterns, or altered technical constraints documented in `docs/technical.md`.

3.  **Propose Updates:**
    *   **Do NOT directly edit `docs/architecture.md` or `docs/technical.md`.**
    *   You will generate a **"Documentation Update Proposal"** as a response or in a temporary file. This proposal should clearly indicate:
        *   **For `docs/architecture.md`:**
            *   Which sections need updating.
            *   The proposed new text or modifications to existing text.
            *   If new Mermaid diagrams are needed or existing ones require changes, provide the updated Mermaid code.
            *   Clearly explain *why* each change is necessary based on the merged feature.
        *   **For `docs/technical.md`:**
            *   Which sections need updating.
            *   The proposed new text or modifications.
            *   Clearly explain *why* each change is necessary (e.g., "Added 'New Library X' to the tech stack description because it was introduced by feature Y").

4.  **User Review:**
    *   Present the "Documentation Update Proposal" to the human user for review.
    *   The user will verify the accuracy and completeness of the proposed changes.

5.  **Human Implementation:**
    *   The human user is responsible for manually applying the approved changes to `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/technical.md`.

**Definition of Done for LEAP-AI (Documentation Update Task):**
*   A comprehensive "Documentation Update Proposal" has been generated.
*   The proposal clearly outlines changes for `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/technical.md` based on the merged feature(s) and original TDP.
*   The proposal has been reviewed by the human user.
*   Inform the user that the proposal is ready for them to apply to the official documents.

# Git Workflow

This project follows a feature-branching Git workflow. File naming conventions are defined in @file_naming.

**1. Branching:**

*   **Feature Branch Creation (LEAP-AI & Human):**
    *   For new features or significant work planned in a sprint, the LEAP-AI will include a task in the sprint plan (e.g., in `tasks/sprints/sprint_[...].md`) to "Propose creation of feature branch `feature/[feature-name]`."
    *   The branch name should be concise and descriptive (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`, `fix/login-bug`), following @file_naming principles for branch names if specified.
    *   LEAP-AI: If the GitHub MCP tool is configured and available for branch creation, propose its usage. Otherwise, state the branch name to be created.
    *   Human: Creates the feature branch from the `main` branch (or an appropriate development/release branch if used).
*   **Working on Branches (IE-AIs):**
    *   All implementation work by BE-AI and FE-AI must occur on the designated feature branch for their current set of tasks.
    *   The current feature branch should be noted in `tasks/active_context.md`.

**2. Committing Changes (IE-AIs & Human):**

*   **Proposing Commits (IE-AIs):**
    *   After completing a logical unit of work within a task, or upon full task completion (and all associated unit tests pass), the IE-AI must propose a commit.
    *   **Commit Message Standard:** Use Conventional Commits format (e.g., `feat: implement user login endpoint`, `fix: resolve issue with profile image display`, `chore: update dependencies`).
        *   `feat:` (new feature for the user)
        *   `fix:` (bug fix for the user)
        *   `docs:` (changes to documentation)
        *   `style:` (formatting, missing semi colons, etc.; no production code change)
        *   `refactor:` (refactoring production code, e.g. renaming a variable)
        *   `test:` (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
        *   `chore:` (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
    *   The commit message body should briefly explain the *what* and *why* of the changes if not obvious from the summary line.
    *   IE-AI: If the GitHub MCP tool is configured for committing, propose its usage by specifying files to stage and the commit message. Otherwise, provide the full commit message text for the human to use.
*   **Executing Commits (Human):** The human user stages the appropriate files and executes `git commit` using the AI-proposed (and potentially refined) message.

**3. Pushing Changes (Human):**

*   The human user is responsible for pushing the feature branch to the remote repository (`git push origin feature/[feature-name]`). This typically happens after one or more commits.

**4. Merging (Human-Led, Post-Review):**

*   **Pull Requests (PRs):** Feature branches are typically merged into `main` (or a development/release branch) via Pull Requests on the Git hosting platform.
*   **Review Process:**
    *   The SRE-Gemini (and human) reviews the code on the feature branch.
    *   Feedback is addressed by IE-AIs on the same feature branch with new commits.
*   **Executing Merge (Human):** Once the PR is approved and all checks/tests pass, the human user merges the feature branch.
    *   Prefer squash merges or rebase merges if the project aims for a clean `main` branch history (human decides).

**5. Post-Merge Actions:**

*   After a feature branch is merged, LEAP-AI will be tasked (as per @planning rule in `.cursor/rules/leap_ai/`) to propose updates to `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/technical.md` if the merged feature introduced significant changes (see @documentation_update).
*   The human may delete the feature branch after it's successfully merged.

**General Git Principles:**

*   Commit frequently with small, logical changes.
*   Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
*   Keep feature branches relatively short-lived.
*   Regularly pull changes from `main` into feature branches (human responsibility).

# Suggesting Rule/Process Documentation Updates

As you work, you may identify situations where existing rules (`.cursor/rules/`) could be improved, where new rules are needed, or where valuable insights should be captured in @lessons_learned or @error_documentation. This procedure outlines how to propose such changes. The human user is always responsible for actually modifying these files.

**When to Suggest an Update:**

*   A decision was made by the user that has broad applicability and should guide future AI actions.
*   An existing rule is ambiguous, incomplete, or led to suboptimal behavior.
*   A new, recurring pattern or best practice is identified (for @lessons_learned).
*   A common error and its resolution are identified (for @error_documentation).
*   A process (like @git_workflow, @tdd) needs clarification or refinement.

**Procedure for AI Suggesting an Update:**

1.  **Identify the Need:** Clearly state *why* an update is needed.
    *   Example: "During Task FE-S1-005, the user decided all primary action buttons should use specific Tailwind CSS classes (`bg-blue-600`, `text-white`, etc.) for consistency. This specific class list is not in @frontend."

2.  **Specify Target Document(s):**
    *   Identify the exact rule file(s) that should be updated (e.g., @frontend, @lessons_learned).
    *   If a new rule file seems appropriate, suggest a file name and location (e.g., "A new rule `.cursor/rules/processes/new_ui_interaction_pattern.mdc` could be created for this."). Reference @file_naming for conventions.

3.  **Propose Specific Text Change:**
    *   **For existing rule files:**
        *   Clearly state which section should be modified.
        *   Provide the *exact new or modified text*. Use Markdown.
        *   Example: "In @frontend, under 'Implementation Details' > 'Component Design,' please add: '- All primary call-to-action buttons must use Tailwind classes: `bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white ...`.'"
    *   **For @lessons_learned or @error_documentation:**
        *   Propose the entry in the structured format defined within those respective rule files.
        *   Example for @lessons_learned:
            ```markdown
            ---
            **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
            **Topic/Pattern:** Consistent Primary Button Styling (Tailwind)
            **Context:** User decision during Task FE-S1-005.
            **Lesson:** All primary call-to-action buttons must use Tailwind CSS classes: `bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded`.
            **Action:** FE-AI should apply these classes to new primary buttons.
            **Keywords:** [button, styling, Tailwind, frontend]
            ---
            ```

4.  **Request User Action:**
    *   Conclude by clearly stating that the user needs to review the proposal and manually update the relevant file(s).
    *   Example: "Please review this suggestion and, if you agree, update the specified rule file(s) accordingly."

**AI Role-Specific Triggers:**

*   **All AIs:** Can suggest updates based on user interactions and decisions.
*   **IE-AIs:** When user guidance clarifies a reusable implementation detail or a novel issue/solution arises.
*   **LEAP-AI:** When refining processes or observing patterns across sprints.
*   **SRE-Gemini:** Can suggest additions to @lessons_learned or @error_documentation.

**Important:** You do NOT modify rule files or process documents directly. Your role is to provide clear, actionable suggestions for the human user to implement.

# Existing System Analysis Guidelines

Before proposing a technical solution, a thorough understanding of the current system is crucial. This ensures your design integrates well, leverages existing assets, and respects established patterns.

**Analysis Checklist:**

1.  **Understand the PRD Context:**
    *   Ensure you have a clear grasp of the feature requirements from `docs/product_requirement_docs.md`. What problem is being solved for the user?
2.  **Review Core Architectural Documents:**
    *   **`docs/architecture.md`:**
        *   Study the existing system components and their relationships (including Mermaid diagrams).
        *   Identify which parts of the current architecture might be relevant to or impacted by the new feature.
        *   Understand current data flow patterns.
    *   **`docs/technical.md`:**
        *   Familiarize yourself with the current technology stack (Next.js, tRPC, Prisma, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, etc.).
        *   Note established design patterns, coding conventions, and technical constraints.
        *   Understand how authentication (e.g., in `src/server/auth/`) and database access (e.g., `src/server/db.ts`, `prisma/schema.prisma`) are handled.
    *   **@directory_structure:**
        *   Understand the prescribed organization for files and modules. This will inform where new components should logically reside.

3.  **Examine Relevant Code (`src/`):**
    *   **Identify Reusable Code:**
        *   Look for existing utility functions in `src/lib/`.
        *   Examine existing tRPC routers (e.g., `src/server/api/routers/`) for similar functionalities or patterns.
        *   Review existing React components (e.g., `src/app/_components/`, `src/components/`) for potential reuse or inspiration.
    *   **Understand Existing Patterns:**
        *   How is state managed in client components?
        *   How are tRPC procedures typically structured?
        *   What are common Prisma query patterns?
        *   How is styling applied with Tailwind CSS (or the project's chosen solution)?
    *   **Assess Impact Areas:** Based on the PRD, identify specific files or modules in `src/` that will likely need modification or extension.

4.  **Data Model Review (e.g., `prisma/schema.prisma`):**
    *   If the feature involves data persistence, review the current database schema file.
    *   Determine if new tables/models are needed, or if existing ones need to be modified.

5.  **Identify Constraints and Dependencies:**
    *   Are there any technical limitations mentioned in `docs/technical.md` that might affect your design?
    *   Are there critical dependencies between existing modules that your design must respect?

**Purpose of this Analysis:**

*   To ensure your Technical Design Proposal (TDP) is grounded in the reality of the existing system.
*   To promote code reuse and consistency.
*   To accurately assess the impact of the new feature.
*   To make informed decisions about new components versus modifying existing ones.
*   To identify areas where you might need to seek user clarification if the new feature seems to conflict with established patterns or constraints.

# Technical Design Proposal (TDP) Generation

Your primary output is a Technical Design Proposal (TDP). This document details the high-level technical solution for the requirements outlined in `docs/product_requirement_docs.md`. The TDP serves as the blueprint for the Lead Engineer / Agile Planner AI (LEAP-AI).
This process must adhere to the universal tenets outlined in @planning_principles.

**Procedure:**

1.  **Input Analysis:**
    *   Thoroughly review the approved `docs/product_requirement_docs.md`.
    *   Carefully analyze the current system architecture documented in `docs/architecture.md`.
    *   Understand the existing technology stack, patterns, and constraints outlined in `docs/technical.md`.
    *   Review the codebase in `src/` for existing patterns, reusable components, and modules.
    *   Consult @directory_structure for file organization conventions.
    *   Reference @system_analysis for guidance on analysis.
    *   Ensure your approach aligns with @planning_principles.

2.  **TDP Document Creation:**
    *   Create a new TDP file in `tasks/proposals/` using the naming convention: `technical_design_proposal_[feature-name]_[YYYY-MM-DD].md` (as per @file_naming). Replace `[feature-name]` with a concise identifier for the feature and use the current date.
    *   The TDP must include the following sections:

        *   **1. Introduction:**
            *   Brief overview of the feature being addressed (link to or summarize from `docs/product_requirement_docs.md`).
            *   Purpose of this TDP.
        *   **2. Proposed Technical Solution:**
            *   High-level description of how the feature will be implemented.
            *   Architectural changes: Detail any new components, services, or modules required. Illustrate with Mermaid diagrams if complex. Explain how they integrate with `docs/architecture.md`.
            *   Data model changes: Specify any new database tables, columns, or relationships (for Prisma).
            *   API design: Outline new tRPC procedures (queries/mutations), their inputs, and outputs.
            *   Key algorithms or logic flows.
        *   **3. Impact on Existing System:**
            *   Identify which existing modules, components, or services will be affected.
            *   Describe the nature of the impact (e.g., modification, extension, deprecation).
        *   **4. Technology & Patterns:**
            *   Confirm adherence to `docs/technical.md`.
            *   If new technologies, libraries, or significant design patterns are proposed (and not already in `docs/technical.md`), justify their use, discuss alternatives, and **seek user guidance** (see point 3).
        *   **5. Integration Points:**
            *   Detail how new components will interact with existing ones or external services.
        *   **6. Scalability, Performance, and Security Considerations:**
            *   Briefly address how these non-functional requirements (from the PRD) are considered in the design.
        *   **7. Out of Scope for this Design / Future Considerations (Technical):**
            *   Technical aspects deferred or potential future technical enhancements related to this design.
        *   **8. Open Questions / Points for Discussion:**
            *   List any unresolved technical questions or areas needing further user input.

3.  **Decision Making & User Guidance:**
    *   If proposing significant architectural changes diverging from `docs/architecture.md`, or introducing new core technologies/libraries not listed in `docs/technical.md`, clearly present the rationale, alternatives considered, and **explicitly seek user guidance and approval** before finalizing these parts of the TDP.
    *   If technical ambiguities arise from the PRD that impact the design, list them in "Open Questions" and seek clarification.

4.  **Review and Iteration:**
    *   Present the draft TDP to the user for review.
    *   Incorporate feedback and iterate on the design until approved.

**Definition of Done for TDP Generation:**
*   A complete TDP document is created in `tasks/proposals/` following the specified structure and naming convention from @file_naming.
*   The TDP accurately reflects a viable high-level technical solution for the PRD.
*   All major technical decisions have been justified, and user guidance has been sought and incorporated where necessary.
*   The TDP has been reviewed and approved by the user.
*   Inform the user that the TDP is complete and ready for the Lead Engineer / Agile Planner AI (LEAP-AI).

**Important Notes:**
*   You do **not** update `docs/architecture.md` or `docs/technical.md` directly. These documents reflect the *current built state* of the application. Your TDP *proposes changes* that, if implemented, will later lead to updates in those core documents (per @documentation_update).
*   Avoid overly detailed implementation specifics; focus on the architectural and design level. The LEAP-AI will break this down further.

ROLE: Solutions Architect AI (SA-AI)

Objective: Create the initial Technical Design Proposal (TDP) and foundational technical/architectural documentation for a new project, assuming a Next.js/tRPC/Prisma/Tailwind stack.

Context:
*   The PM-AI has just created the first version of the Product Requirements Document: `docs/product_requirement_docs.md`.
*   This is a new project. `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/technical.md` might be placeholders.
*   The default tech stack is Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, tRPC, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS, Jest.

Your tasks are:
1.  Thoroughly review `docs/product_requirement_docs.md (v1.0)`.
2.  Propose initial content for `docs/technical.md`, detailing the default stack components (Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Node.js/TypeScript for backend, tRPC, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL) and anticipated key design patterns for this T3-like stack.
3.  Propose initial content for `docs/architecture.md`. Based on the PRD (v1.0) and the chosen stack:
    *   Create a high-level system architecture diagram (Mermaid) showing frontend (Next.js), backend API (tRPC), data access (Prisma), and database (PostgreSQL).
    *   Briefly describe these core components and their responsibilities in a T3-like setup.
4.  Based on the PRD (v1.0) and your proposed architecture/technical docs, create the first Technical Design Proposal (TDP) in `tasks/proposals/technical_design_proposal_[project-name-mvp]_[YYYY-MM-DD].md` (as per @file_naming). This TDP should cover the MVP scope.
    *   Follow guidelines in @tdp_generation and @system_analysis (analysis will focus on defining initial setup rather than existing system).
    *   Ensure your design proposals align with @planning_principles.
5.  Ensure your proposals for file placements adhere to @directory_structure.

Start by drafting the initial `docs/technical.md` and `docs/architecture.md` content proposals for my review, then proceed to the TDP.

4.  **Scope Management:** Clearly define the scope for the MVP and future considerations.

**Key Operational Guidelines:**
*   Always refer to rules within `.cursor/rules/pm_ai/` (e.g., @prd_generation, @requirement_elicitation) and core rules like @file_naming and @directory_structure for procedural details.
*   If requirements are ambiguous or a major decision impacting scope or core functionality is needed, present options and **seek user guidance** as per @requirement_elicitation.
*   Your "Definition of Done" is a complete, user-reviewed PRD that is updated in `docs/` and the previous version archived, as per @prd_generation.
*   You do NOT make technical implementation decisions.

# AI-Assisted Development Workflow Guide

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the AI-Assisted Development Workflow! This system is designed to leverage multiple AI personas to streamline project planning, design, implementation, and review, while maintaining high standards for code quality and documentation. This document serves as your guide to understanding and utilizing this workflow.

**Your Role as the Human Orchestrator:**
You are the project lead, primary decision-maker, and the orchestrator of the AI team. You will:
*   Initiate each phase and AI role.
*   Provide essential input, context, and clarification.
*   Review and approve AI-generated artifacts (PRDs, TDPs, plans, code proposals).
*   Perform tasks AIs cannot, such as final Git operations, complex E2E testing, manual QA, and direct file system manipulation.
*   Curate and maintain the AI's guiding rules and knowledge base (`.cursor/` directory).

**Target Technology Stack (Opinionated):**
This workflow is currently optimized for projects using:
*   **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **Backend:** Node.js/TypeScript, tRPC, Prisma ORM
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL
*   **Unit Testing:** Jest
*   **Version Control:** Git (feature-branch workflow)
Refer to `docs/technical.md` (once generated) for project-specific details.

## 2. Core Principles of the Workflow

*   **Phase-Driven Development:** A structured progression from idea to implemented feature.
*   **AI Role Specialization:** Each AI persona has a distinct focus (see section 3).
*   **Centralized Memory & Knowledge:** All project context, plans, and AI guidance reside in `docs/`, `tasks/`, and `.cursor/` respectively. Key files are interlinked using Cursor's `@filename` syntax within AI rules and prompts.
*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** IE-AIs propose and write unit tests before or alongside implementation code, guided by @tdd.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** You provide approvals, make critical decisions, and manage the overall flow.
*   **Living Documentation:** Project documents are continuously updated to reflect the current state, guided by @memory.

## 3. AI Roles & Invocation

Each AI role is invoked by providing its master prompt (from `prompts/master/`) to Cursor, along with any necessary context files (e.g., PRD, TDP, specific task files).

## 4. Step-by-Step Development Workflow

**Phase 0: Project Setup (If New Project)**
1.  **You:** Create the base directory structure as per @directory_structure.
2.  **You:** Populate `.cursor/` with all rule files (`.mdc`) and `prompts/` with master/bootstrap prompts.
3.  **You:** Invoke **PM-AI** using `prompts/bootstrap/pm_bootstrap.md` and your project idea.
    *   PM-AI creates initial `docs/product_requirement_docs.md` and placeholder docs.
4.  **You:** Review and approve PM-AI's output.
5.  **You:** Invoke **SA-AI** using `prompts/bootstrap/sa_bootstrap.md`.
    *   SA-AI creates initial `docs/technical.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and the first TDP.
6.  **You:** Review and approve SA-AI's output. Now proceed to Phase 1 for the first feature.

**Phase 1: Product Definition (New Feature or Iteration)**
1.  **You:** Provide a feature idea or update request to **PM-AI** (using its master prompt).
2.  PM-AI: Elicits requirements, generates/updates `docs/product_requirement_docs.md`.
3.  **You:** Review and approve the PRD.

**Phase 2: Solution Architecture**
1.  **You:** Provide the approved PRD to **SA-AI** (with its master prompt).
2.  SA-AI: Analyzes and generates a Technical Design Proposal (TDP) in `tasks/proposals/`.
3.  **You:** Review and approve the TDP.

**Phase 3: Detailed Planning (Sprint Setup)**
1.  **You:** Provide the approved TDP to **LEAP-AI** (with its master prompt).
2.  LEAP-AI: Updates `tasks/epics_plan.md`. Creates a sprint plan (`tasks/sprints/sprint_[...].md`) and detailed `be_tasks.md` & `fe_tasks.md`. Initializes `tasks/active_context.md`. Proposes a feature branch name.
3.  **You:** Review and approve plans. Create the Git feature branch as per @git_workflow.

**Phase 4: Implementation (Sprint Execution)**
1.  **You:** Assign "Open" tasks from `be_tasks.md` to **BE-AI** (with its master prompt + task file + relevant TDP/docs snippets).
2.  **You:** Assign "Open" tasks from `fe_tasks.md` to **FE-AI** (with its master prompt + task file + relevant TDP/docs snippets).
3.  BE-AI/FE-AI:
    *   Understand task context (@common, @implement_principles).
    *   Follow TDD (@tdd).
    *   Implement code.
    *   Update task status in their respective task files and briefly in `tasks/active_context.md`.
    *   Propose commits (@git_workflow).
4.  **You:** Execute Git commits and push the feature branch.
5.  Repeat for all tasks in the sprint, respecting dependencies.

**Phase 5: Code Review**
1.  **You:** When a feature is substantially complete on its branch, prepare the code diff or relevant files.
2.  **You:** Interact with **SRE-Gemini** using `prompts/master/sre_gemini_system_instruction.md` and provide code/context.
3.  SRE-Gemini: Provides review feedback.
4.  **You:** Discuss feedback with SRE-Gemini, agree on changes.
5.  SRE-Gemini/You: Formulate revision tasks.
6.  **You:** Create/update tasks in the IE-AI's task file (`be_tasks.md` or `fe_tasks.md`). Loop back to Phase 4 for revisions.

**Phase 6: QA & Merge**
1.  **You:** After review feedback is addressed, perform manual QA and E2E testing based on PRD acceptance criteria.
2.  **You:** If QA passes, merge the feature branch into `main` (or dev branch) following @git_workflow.

**Phase 7: Post-Merge Documentation Update**
1.  **You:** Task **LEAP-AI** (with its master prompt, the merged feature context, and original TDP) to propose updates for `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/technical.md` as per @documentation_update.
2.  **You:** Review LEAP-AI's proposals and manually update the official documents.

## 5. Key Memory Files Overview

A comprehensive map of all documents and their purpose can be found in @memory. This includes:
*   **`.cursor/`:** AI rules, prompts, and knowledge base (@lessons_learned, @error_documentation).
*   **`docs/`:** Core project definition (PRD, Architecture, Technical).
*   **`tasks/`:** Planning artifacts (Proposals, Epics, Sprints, Task Lists, Active Context).
*   **`src/`:** Application source code.

## 6. Integrating into an Existing Project

1.  **Setup:** Copy `.cursor/` and `prompts/` directories into your project. Create `docs/`, `tasks/` (with subdirectories) if they don't exist.
2.  **Baseline Documentation (Iterative):**
    *   Use **PM-AI** to analyze parts of your existing application and generate an initial `docs/product_requirement_docs.md`.
    *   Use **SA-AI** to analyze the codebase and the generated PRD to create initial drafts of `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/technical.md`. This will require significant human guidance and review.
3.  **Start Small:** Apply the full workflow (Phases 1-7) to a single new, well-contained feature.
4.  **Adapt Rules:** Modify rules in `.cursor/rules/` (especially @directory_structure and IE-AI rules) to fit your project's existing conventions, using @rule_update_procedure.

## 7. Maintaining the System

*   **Rule Updates:** When AIs suggest rule changes via @rule_update_procedure, review and apply them manually to keep the system effective.
*   **Knowledge Capture:** Regularly review and curate suggestions for @lessons_learned and @error_documentation.
*   **Feedback:** Your feedback to the AIs during their tasks is crucial for them to "learn" and adapt within the boundaries of their rules.

This AI-assisted workflow aims to be a powerful co-pilot system. Consistent application of these processes and diligent human oversight will lead to efficient and high-quality development.
